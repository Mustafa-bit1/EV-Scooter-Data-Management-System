## üìå Project Overview  
This project consists of an **EV Dashboard Android app** that continuously **sends real-time vehicle data** to a **Spring Boot backend** using **Retrofit**. The backend processes and **stores the data in a PostgreSQL database**, dynamically creating tables for each vehicle based on its **VIN number**.  

Simultaneously, a **Companion Mobile App** connects to the server, requests **real-time data**, and displays it to the user, ensuring seamless monitoring and control.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Android (Dashboard & Companion App)** ‚Äì Retrofit for API communication  
- **Spring Boot** ‚Äì RESTful API backend  
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Database storage with dynamic VIN-based tables  
- **Cloud Deployment** ‚Äì For scalable real-time data processing  
- **WebSockets/HTTP** ‚Äì For real-time data transmission  

## üîó System Architecture  
1. **EV Dashboard App:**  
   - Continuously collects and sends **SoC, Location, Temperature, TirePressure and other telemetry data** to the backend.  
   - Uses **Retrofit** for secure and efficient data transmission.  

2. **Spring Boot Backend:**  
   - Recognizes the **phone number** linked to a vehicle via its **VIN number**.  
   - Dynamically creates a **dedicated table** for each vehicle in **PostgreSQL**.  
   - Stores incoming telemetry data in real time.  

3. **Companion Mobile App:**  
   - Authenticates the user and fetches **only the assigned vehicle‚Äôs data**.  
   - Requests real-time telemetry updates from the server.  
   - Displays key vehicle parameters such as **battery status, speed, and diagnostics**.
